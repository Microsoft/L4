# L4 HashTable
L4 (Lock-Free on Read) Hashtable is a C++ library that provides a fixed-size hashtable, where keys and values are arbitrary bytes.

L4 HashTable is optimized for lookup operations. It uses [Epoch Queue](https://github.com/Microsoft/L4/wiki/Epoch-Queue) (deterministic garbage collector) to achieve lock-free lookup operations.

L4 HashTable supports caching based on memory size and time. It uses [Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm#Clock) algorithm for an efficient cache eviction.

L4 HashTable is built with interprocess communication in mind and its shared memory implementation (multiple-readers-single-writer model at process level) is coming soon.

## Installation
### Visual C++ (Windows)
This library is developed and maintained with Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio 2019 Community is available for free [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community).

To get started, open the **L4.sln** file and build the solution. Initially, it will automatically start downloading [boost NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/boost/) before build starts.

### GCC
This library is tested with GCC 6.2. You can run the following commands to get started:
```
cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=<boost root directory> CMakeLists.txt
make
make test
```
